# Generative UI with Flutter

This repository contains examples and resources from the Generative UI with Flutter talk. Here, you’ll find code and sample implementations for creating adaptive and dynamic UIs using Flutter and AI-driven tools. These examples illustrate the power of combining Flutter’s UI capabilities with generative AI, allowing for context-based UI generation and enhanced interactivity in applications.

## About

In this session, we explore the use of generative AI models, particularly focusing on how tools like the google_generative_ai SDK and Flutter AI toolkit can enable more adaptive, responsive, and intelligent UI experiences. The session demonstrates how generative UI differs from simple AI-assisted code generation, emphasizing the orchestration of dynamic user experiences.

## Features

- Widget Schemas: Dynamically generated widget structures that adapt based on input context.
- Function Calls within LLMs: Use of Gemini’s function calling capabilities for contextually accurate UI responses.
- Interactive Widgets: UI elements that respond to real-time inputs, facilitating a seamless user experience.

## Code Highlights

- Light Control System: A demo showcasing function-based UI state management for interactive brightness control.
- Form Generation: Example schemas that dynamically populate widgets like dropdowns and color pickers.
- Widget Responses: Integrates with Flutter AI Toolkit for live, interactive UI rendering based on schema inputs.
## Setup

	1.	Clone this repository
	2.	Install dependencies using flutter pub get
	3.	Run the main app with flutter run

## Session Description

Session Title: Generative UI with Flutter: Creating Adaptive Experiences

In this session, you’ll discover the core concepts of generative UI, an approach for developing dynamic and responsive interfaces that adjust based on user context, input, and other conditions.

Explore the Gemini model alongside Flutter AI Toolkit to implement real-world generative UI solutions, covering:

- Practical applications for adaptive interface generation
- The integration of Gemini’s function calling to manage state and context
- Design principles for maintaining UI consistency and performance

Attendees will leave with insights and tools to apply generative principles to their own production applications, simplifying complex workflows and enhancing UX adaptability.
